This plexus arises from the anterior rami of spinal nerves C5-T1 that undergo several mergers and splits into trunks and divisions, until they finally give rise to their terminal branches. These terminal branches are responsible for motor and sensory innervation of the upper limb, and they include the musculocutaneous, axillary, radial, median and ulnar nerves. So, the brachial plexus originates from the ventral rami of the spinal nerves C5-T1. These rami quickly merge to form 3 trunks, which subsequently split into anterior and posterior division. This yields a total of 6 divisions (3 anterior and 3 posterior), which continue to pass inferiorly behind the clavicle to enter the axillary region. Finally, the divisions merge into cords of the brachial plexus, that give off the terminal branches of the brachial plexus. </p>',
